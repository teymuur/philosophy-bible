        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Michel Foucault, a profound 20th-century philosopher, is best known for his critical studies of various social institutions and his theories on the relationship between power and knowledge. His work has had a significant impact on a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, and literary theory.</p>
        <h3 id="life-and-historical-context">Life and Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Michel Foucault was born in 1926 in Poitiers, France. He studied philosophy and psychology at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. His career was marked by his radical approach to the study of history and society, focusing on the ways in which power and knowledge intersect and shape human behavior. Foucault's ideas were deeply influenced by his own political activism and the social upheavals of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
        <h3 id="key-ideas-and-philosophical-contributions">Key Ideas and Philosophical Contributions</h3>

        <ol type="1">

            <li><p><strong>Biopower</strong>: This concept refers to the practice of modern states and their regulation of their citizens through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the control of populations."</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Disciplinary Power</strong>: Foucault examined how institutions exert control over individuals through surveillance and normalization, creating "docile bodies" that conform to societal expectations.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Archaeology of Knowledge</strong>: Foucault's method of analyzing historical discourses to uncover the rules and structures that govern the production of knowledge in different periods.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Genealogy</strong>: A historical technique used by Foucault to trace the development and transformations of power relations and their impact on knowledge and social practices.</p></li>
