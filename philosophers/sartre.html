        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Jean-Paul Sartre, a leading figure in 20th-century philosophy, is best known for his contributions to existentialism. His works explore the themes of freedom, responsibility, and the nature of human existence.</p>
        <h3 id="life-and-historical-context">Life and Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Born in 1905 in Paris, Jean-Paul Sartre studied philosophy at the École Normale Supérieure. His experiences during World War II, including his time as a prisoner of war, deeply influenced his existentialist outlook. Sartre's prolific career included novels, plays, essays, and philosophical texts, making him a central figure in existentialist and phenomenological thought.</p>
        <h3 id="key-ideas-and-philosophical-contributions">Key Ideas and Philosophical Contributions</h3>
        <p>Sartre's existentialism centers on the concepts of human freedom, individual responsibility, and the search for meaning in an indifferent universe.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><p><strong>Existence Precedes Essence</strong>: Sartre argued that humans are not born with a predetermined essence or purpose. Instead, individuals create their own essence through actions and choices, emphasizing the primacy of existence over predefined nature.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Freedom and Responsibility</strong>: According to Sartre, humans are condemned to be free, meaning that they must constantly make choices and bear the responsibility for the consequences. This freedom can be a source of anxiety but also allows for authentic existence.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Bad Faith</strong>: Sartre introduced the concept of bad faith to describe the self-deception individuals engage in to avoid acknowledging their freedom and responsibility. Bad faith involves denying one's own freedom and adopting false values imposed by society.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>The Look and the Other</strong>: Sartre explored the dynamics of human relationships, particularly the concept of "the look," where the presence of others imposes limitations on one's freedom. This encounter with the other leads to a struggle for self-definition and recognition.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Nausea and Absurdity</strong>: In his novel "Nausea," Sartre depicts the protagonist's realization of the absurdity and contingency of existence. This theme of absurdity is central to existentialism, highlighting the lack of inherent meaning in life.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="influence-and-legacy">Influence and Legacy</h3>
        <p>Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialist philosophy has had a profound impact on various fields, including literature, psychology, politics, and theology. His ideas influenced existentialist thinkers such as Simone de Beauvoir and Albert Camus. Sartre's work continues to be studied and debated, offering insights into the human condition and the challenges of living authentically.</p>
        <h3 id="notable-works">Notable Works</h3>
        <p>Sartre's extensive body of work explores existentialist themes and their implications for human life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Being and Nothingness</strong>: Sartre's magnum opus, which provides a detailed analysis of existentialist ontology, freedom, and bad faith.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Nausea</strong>: A novel that explores the themes of existential angst and the absurdity of existence through the experiences of its protagonist.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Existentialism is a Humanism</strong>: A lecture where Sartre defends existentialism against its critics and clarifies its core principles.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>The Flies</strong>: A play that reinterprets the myth of Orestes, exploring themes of freedom, responsibility, and rebellion.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>No Exit</strong>: A play that famously concludes "Hell is other people," examining the complexities of human relationships and self-deception.</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Jean-Paul Sartre's existentialism challenges individuals to confront their freedom and take responsibility for their choices. By emphasizing the creation of meaning through action and the rejection of predetermined essence, Sartre's philosophy offers a powerful framework for understanding human existence and striving for authenticity in a complex world.</p>
