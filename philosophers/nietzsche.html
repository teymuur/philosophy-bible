        <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
        <p>Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the most influential and provocative philosophers of the 19th century, challenged conventional thinking and questioned the foundations of Western morality, religion, and culture. His writings on the "will to power," the "Übermensch," and the "eternal recurrence" continue to inspire and provoke debate. Nietzsche's work invites us to rethink our values and embrace the transformative power of philosophy.</p>
        <h3 id="life-and-historical-context">Life and Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Friedrich Nietzsche was born in 1844 in Röcken, Prussia (now Germany). He initially pursued a career in classical philology before turning to philosophy. Nietzsche's tumultuous life was marked by periods of intense creativity and debilitating illness. Despite his relatively short productive period, Nietzsche's work had a profound impact on subsequent generations of thinkers.</p>

            <li><p><strong>Übermensch (Overman)</strong>: In "Thus Spoke Zarathustra," Nietzsche introduced the concept of the Übermensch, an individual who transcends conventional morality to create new values and meaning.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Eternal Recurrence</strong>: Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence challenges us to live our lives as if they were to be repeated infinitely, embracing every moment with affirmation.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Critique of Religion and Morality</strong>: Nietzsche famously declared "God is dead," critiquing the foundations of Christian morality and advocating for a reevaluation of all values.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Dionysian and Apollonian</strong>: Nietzsche contrasted the Dionysian (representing chaos, passion, and instinct) with the Apollonian (representing order, reason, and harmony) as fundamental aspects of human experience.</p></li>
        </ol>
