        <h3 id="life-and-historical-context">Life and Historical Context</h3>
        <p>Gilles Deleuze was born in 1925 in Paris, France. He studied philosophy at the Sorbonne, where he was influenced by thinkers such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Henri Bergson.

        <h3 id="key-ideas-and-philosophical-contributions">Key Ideas and Philosophical Contributions</h3>
        <p>Deleuze's philosophy is known for its innovative concepts and its departure from traditional philosophical thought.</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li><p><strong>Rhizome</strong>: Deleuze and Guattari introduced the concept of the rhizome to describe a non-hierarchical, interconnected form of knowledge and existence. Unlike a tree, which has a single trunk and branches, a rhizome spreads out in all directions, reflecting the complexity and multiplicity of reality.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Becoming</strong>: Deleuze emphasized the idea of becoming rather than being, focusing on processes of change and transformation rather than static states of existence.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Difference and Repetition</strong>: In his work <em>Difference and Repetition</em>, Deleuze explores the nature of difference and its role in the production of identity and reality, challenging traditional notions of sameness and identity.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Assemblage</strong>: Deleuze and Guattari developed the concept of assemblage to describe complex systems composed of heterogeneous elements. Assemblages are dynamic and constantly changing, reflecting the fluid nature of reality.</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Body without Organs</strong>: This concept, derived from the work of Antonin Artaud, refers to a state of existence free from hierarchical structures and fixed identities. It represents a form of pure potentiality and creative freedom.</p></li>
        </ol>
